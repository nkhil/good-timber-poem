    <h3>A poem by Douglas Malloch</h3>
    <img src="img/down_arrow.png" class="down_arrow" alt="">
    <h4>The tree that never had to fight</h4>
    <h4>For sun and sky and air and light,</h4>
    <h4>But stood out in the open plain</h4>
    <h4>And always got its share of rain</h4>
    <h4>Never became a forest king</h4>
    <h4>But lived and died a scrubby thing.</h4>
    <img src="img/dead.png" alt="">
    <h4>The man who never had to toil</h4>
    <h4>To gain and farm his patch of soil</h4>
    <h4>Who never had to win his share</h4>
    <h4>Of sun and sky and light and air</h4>
    <h4>Never became a manly man</h4>
    <h4>But lived and died as he began.</h4>
