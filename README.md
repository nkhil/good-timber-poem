# A Simple Starter Template With SASS, Gulp, Auto-Reload (using browser-sync) & @media Query Mixins

This is the simplest project setup if you'd like to get going with a single HTML file that uses SASS, Gulp and Browser-Sync. I've also included my favourite @media query mixin as a partial ([credit to David Gilbertson](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862))

### Instructions

* Simply Clone this repository (in your terminal) using `git clone https://github.com/nkhil/simple-boilerplate.git`
* In your terminal, type `npm install` to install the dev devDependencies (Google 'npm' or 'node package manager' if you don't know what 'npm install does')
* Once this is done, simply type `gulp watch` in your terminal (while you're inside the project folder) and you should see browser-sync create a server and serve up the index.html file
* Any changes you make to your index.html file, or the style.scss file should now show up live in your browser.
